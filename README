This is the root directory of the "NoFib Haskell benchmark suite";
version 2.05 (to match our other Glasgow functional-programming
tools).

The main change between version 2.01 and 2.05 is that the programs
have been converted to Haskell 1.4.

We have yet to release the NoFib stuff as we intended -- everything
tidied up -- because it's a lot of work for very few brownie points.
Probably we never will.  As it is, however, it is quite useful as a
Haskell-compiler test suite, so we are not keeping it to ourselves.

This version has *MANY* shortcomings, some of which I hope you will
report, so we can get something "real" out the door.

There are some restrictions on the use of this software.  First of
all, the copyright for the individual programs remains with their
authors (unless they have explicitly said otherwise).  Second, we (the
Glasgow Haskell project at University of Glasgow) retain the copyright
to any changes made to the programs *and* to the collection of
programs itself.  Third, for 2.05, it would be dishonest to suggest
that any results are related to the still-in-the-future "NoFib
benchmark suite".  So please do not make any such claims.

A position paper about the suite is in docs/paper/paper.dvi, and it
includes more than enough indication as to how we intend this suite to
be used.  Of course, we positively *welcome* honest and creative uses
of this suite.

The file BUILDING provides some direction about setting up the suite,
in order to run it. [NOTE: doesn't exist yet; see sketchy notes below]

You may sent comments or bug reports about this suite either to the
Glasgow Haskell bugs list <glasgow-haskell-bugs@dcs.gla.ac.uk>.
They will be most welcome.

== SKETCHY NOTES ==================================================

Quick and dirty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find a program you are interested in, make up a "makefile" by hand,
and try it :-)


Doing things properly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* This version of nofib only supports ghc-2.05, so if you try to use
  other versions of GHC or different Haskell systems, you're going to
  run into some obstacles.

* Plop the nofib distribution inside the Glasgow fptools suite, i.e.,
  unpack nofib at the toplevel at the same level as directories such as
  ghc/ and glafp-utils/.

* Have a look in mk/config.mk.in to see what variables control the nofib setup.
  If you want to change these, put the new settings for them in the build-specific
  setup file, mk/build.mk

* Run ./configure

* Assuming you haven't built the compiler, you will need to do that first.
  Type "make boot" (or whatever make is called on your system)
  followed by "make all". 

* cd nofib/

* Ready the nofib suite for some use, by running `make boot', which
  takes care of creating Makefile dependendencies.

* If all that worked -- and you'll know if it did -- then do:

    % make -k >& make.log # to compile everything; save log for study
    % make -k runtests >& runtests.log	# also for study
